This package implements a minimal ML-like language to demonstrate how the W
algorithm works.

The 'ML' module contains the definition of the language in the form of an
Haskell data type, plus functions to parse files and pretty print the datatype.

The 'TypeInfer' module contains the W algorithm itself.

The 'Main' module contains a program that parses and typechecks programs reading
from standard input.

The program in 'Main' can be compiled with @make@, and the documentation with
@make docs@. It should work fine with @GHC@ version 6 or 7 (and maybe more). It
can also be loaded and ran with Hugs turning the extensions on (using the @-98@
flag).
